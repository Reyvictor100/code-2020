    <h2>About Myself</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Alexandra Reynaga. I've always had a passion for drawing, 
        sketching, painting, and all around art.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Since I can remember I have always entertained myself with a pen and paper, and 
     just knew this was something I wanted to pursue into my adolescence. The happiness
     it brings me to watch myself create something from nothing is amazing and something
     I look foward to doing as often as I can.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I am so happy you have allowed me to keep my passion going and will be forever
        thankful to those who support me in what I do.
    </p>
